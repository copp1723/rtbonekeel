# Logger Refactor for ESM Compatibility

## Summary of Changes

This refactor standardized all logger usage to be ESM-compliant, with correct import/export style across the codebase.

### Key Changes

1. Created and executed a script (`fix-logger-imports-esm.sh`) to update all logger imports and usage:
   - Changed `import { logger } from '../shared/logger.js';` to `import { debug, info, warn, error } from '../shared/logger.js';`
   - Changed `import logger from '../utils/logger.js';` to `import { debug, info, warn, error } from '../shared/logger.js';`
   - Updated all logger function calls (e.g., `logger.info()` to `info()`)
   - Preserved the `.js` extension in imports for ESM compatibility

2. Manually fixed remaining logger-related issues in specific files:
   - `src/core/ai/index.ts`
   - `src/core/ai/llmAuditLogger.ts`
   - `src/core/ai/modelFallback.ts`
   - `src/core/ai/openai.ts`
   - `src/core/ai/promptTemplate.ts`
   - `src/shared/errorHandler.ts`

### Verification

The changes were verified by:
1. Checking the updated imports in several files
2. Running a build to ensure no new logger-related errors were introduced

### Remaining Issues

There are still some TypeScript errors in the codebase, but they are unrelated to the logger refactoring. These errors include:

1. Missing type declarations for various modules
2. Type compatibility issues
3. Other ESM-related issues

These issues should be addressed in separate tickets.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining TypeScript errors
2. Consider standardizing on a single logger implementation (currently there are two: Winston in `src/shared/logger.ts` and Pino in `src/utils/logger.ts`)
3. Update documentation to reflect the new logger usage patterns
