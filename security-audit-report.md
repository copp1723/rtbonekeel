# Security Audit Report

## Overview
This report documents the high and critical npm audit vulnerabilities found in the project and the actions taken to address them.

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **xmldom** (Critical)
   - Issue: xmldom allows multiple root nodes in a DOM (GHSA-crh6-fp67-6883) and misinterpretation of malicious XML input (GHSA-5fg8-2547-mr8q)
   - Dependency Path: @eko-ai/eko > xmldom
   - Resolution: Removed @eko-ai/eko package as it was not being used in the codebase

### High Vulnerabilities

1. **semver** (High)
   - Issue: semver vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw)
   - Dependency Path: utf7 > semver, which is used by imap and imap-simple
   - Resolution: Removed imap and imap-simple packages as they were not being actively used in the codebase

2. **imap** (High)
   - Issue: Depends on vulnerable utf7 package
   - Dependency Path: imap > utf7
   - Resolution: Removed imap package

3. **imap-simple** (High)
   - Issue: Depends on vulnerable imap package
   - Dependency Path: imap-simple > imap
   - Resolution: Removed imap-simple package

### Moderate Vulnerabilities

1. **esbuild** (Moderate)
   - Issue: esbuild enables any website to send any requests to the development server and read the response (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
   - Dependency Path: drizzle-kit > esbuild
   - Resolution: Updated drizzle-kit to version 0.18.1 which reduces the severity of the vulnerability

### Low Vulnerabilities

1. **cookie** (Low)
   - Issue: cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters (GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x)
   - Dependency Path: csurf > cookie
   - Resolution: This is a low-severity issue and fixing it would require a breaking change to csurf. Since the vulnerability is low risk and csurf is used for CSRF protection (which is security-positive), we've accepted this risk.

## Actions Taken

1. Removed unused packages with vulnerabilities:
   - @eko-ai/eko (critical vulnerability in xmldom)
   - imap and imap-simple (high vulnerabilities)

2. Updated packages to resolve moderate vulnerabilities:
   - Updated drizzle-kit to version 0.18.1 to reduce the severity of the esbuild vulnerability

3. Accepted low-risk vulnerabilities:
   - cookie vulnerability in csurf (low severity, breaking change to fix)

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

After remediation, the following vulnerabilities remain:

1. **cookie** (Low) - Accepted risk due to low severity and breaking change required to fix
2. **esbuild** (Moderate) - Partially mitigated by updating drizzle-kit, but a complete fix would require a breaking change

## Recommendations

1. Implement a regular security audit process to identify and address vulnerabilities
2. Consider using alternative email processing libraries if email functionality is needed in the future (imapflow is already in the dependencies and could be used instead of imap/imap-simple)
3. Add npm audit checks to CI/CD pipeline to prevent introduction of vulnerable dependencies
4. Document accepted risks for any vulnerabilities that cannot be resolved

## Conclusion

All high and critical vulnerabilities have been addressed by removing unused dependencies. The remaining low and moderate vulnerabilities have been documented and accepted as the risk is minimal compared to the potential impact of breaking changes. The application should be monitored for any new vulnerabilities that may arise in the future.
