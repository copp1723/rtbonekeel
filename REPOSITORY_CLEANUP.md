# Repository Cleanup Documentation

## Overview

On [Current Date], we performed a repository cleanup to remove unrelated "dealership verification" project files that were accidentally committed in commit `50fe9edc` on March 16, 2025, and later deleted in commit `c3110e4a`. Although these files were deleted, they still existed in the Git history, causing the repository to be unnecessarily large.

## Actions Taken

1. Created a backup of the repository before proceeding
2. Used `git filter-repo` to completely remove the problematic files from the repository history:
   ```
   git filter-repo --path Projects/dealership-verification --invert-paths
   ```
3. Verified the cleanup was successful:
   - Repository size reduced from 130.24 MiB to 9.86 MiB
   - No references to "dealership verification" in the commit history

## Impact

- Reduced repository size by approximately 120 MiB (92% reduction)
- Improved clone, push, and pull operations speed
- Eliminated potential issues with GitHub repository size limits

## Instructions for Team Members

Since the repository history has been rewritten, all team members will need to update their local repositories. Please follow one of these options:

### Option 1: Re-clone the repository (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to the parent directory of your current repository
cd ..

# Rename your current repository as a backup (optional)
mv rtbonekeel rtbonekeel-backup

# Clone the repository again
git clone https://github.com/copp1723/rtbonekeel.git

# Navigate into the newly cloned repository
cd rtbonekeel

# Copy any uncommitted changes from your backup (if needed)
```

### Option 2: Hard Reset (Advanced Users Only)

If you have a complex local setup or many uncommitted changes, you may prefer to reset your local repository:

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd rtbonekeel

# Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin

# Reset your local main branch to match the remote
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# Reset any other branches you're working on
git checkout your-branch-name
git reset --hard origin/your-branch-name  # If the branch exists on remote

# If you have local branches that don't exist on remote, you'll need to recreate them
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to backup any uncommitted changes before performing these steps.

## Prevention Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future, we recommend:

1. Using `.gitignore` files appropriately to exclude large or unnecessary files
2. Being careful when committing large numbers of files at once
3. Reviewing changes before committing
4. Setting up branch protection rules in GitHub:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Restrict who can push to the main branch
5. Implementing pre-commit hooks to prevent committing large files
