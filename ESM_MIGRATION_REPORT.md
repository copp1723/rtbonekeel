# ESM Import Extension Audit & Migration Report

## Summary

This report documents the results of the ESM import extension audit and migration process for the TypeScript project. The goal was to ensure all local relative imports include explicit `.js` extensions as required by ESM when using `"module": "NodeNext"` and `"type": "module"` in package.json.

## Migration Results

- **Files Scanned**: 186
- **Files with Issues**: 94
- **Total Issues Found**: 310
- **Issues Fixed**: 310

## Fixed Issues

The script successfully added `.js` extensions to all local relative imports in the codebase. This includes:

1. Static imports: `import x from './module'` → `import x from './module.js'`
2. Dynamic imports: `import('./module')` → `import('./module.js')`
3. Type imports: `import type { X } from './module'` → `import type { X } from './module.js'`

## Remaining Issues

While the ESM import extension issues have been fixed, there are still other TypeScript errors in the codebase that need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Type Declarations**: Several modules are missing type declarations, such as:
   - `../types/bullmq/index.standardized.js`
   - `openai`
   - `drizzle-orm/postgres-js/driver`
   - `postgres`

2. **Logger Issues**: Many files are importing a non-existent `logger` export:
   ```typescript
   import { logger } from '../shared/logger.js';
   ```
   This should be fixed by either:
   - Exporting a `logger` from the logger module, or
   - Using the correct import pattern for the logger

3. **Type Errors**: Various type errors throughout the codebase, including:
   - Incorrect parameter types
   - Incompatible assignments
   - Missing properties
   - Readonly property assignments

4. **CommonJS Usage**: There is still some CommonJS usage in the codebase:
   ```typescript
   const CryptoJS = require('crypto-js');
   ```
   This should be replaced with ESM imports:
   ```typescript
   import CryptoJS from 'crypto-js';
   ```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Install Missing Type Packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/axios
   ```

2. **Fix Logger Imports**:
   Review the logger implementation and ensure it exports the correct symbols, then update imports accordingly.

3. **Address CommonJS Usage**:
   Replace any remaining `require()` calls with ESM `import` statements.

4. **Fix Type Errors**:
   Work through the remaining TypeScript errors one by one, focusing on:
   - Fixing incorrect parameter types
   - Ensuring proper type definitions
   - Addressing readonly property assignments

5. **Create Missing Type Declarations**:
   For modules without type declarations, create declaration files or install appropriate @types packages.

## Conclusion

The ESM import extension migration was successful, with all 310 identified issues fixed across 94 files. However, there are still other TypeScript errors in the codebase that need to be addressed before the project will compile successfully.

The provided `esm-import-audit.js` script can be used for ongoing maintenance to ensure all new imports follow the ESM pattern with explicit `.js` extensions.
