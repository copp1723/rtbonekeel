# Refactor Notes for Experimental Tools

## Overview

The experimental tools in this directory have been refactored and moved to the main tools directory. This document explains the changes made and the rationale behind them.

## Changes Made

### 1. Canonical Export Pattern

- Implemented named exports instead of default exports
- Added explicit type exports
- Created barrel exports via index.ts
- Added explicit .js extensions in imports

### 2. Code Quality Improvements

- Fixed error handling to avoid redundant type checks
- Improved code organization with better function separation
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Fixed potential security issues

### 3. Documentation

- Added README.md with usage examples
- Added inline documentation
- Created reference documentation in docs/CANONICAL_EXPORTS.md

## Migration Path

If you're using the old experimental tools, update your imports to use the new canonical pattern:

```typescript
// Old way
import { extractCleanContent } from '../pending-review/experimental-features/tools/extractCleanContent';
import { summarizeText } from '../pending-review/experimental-features/tools/summarizeText';

// New way
import { extractCleanContent, summarizeText } from '../tools/index.js';
```

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for the tools
- Implement proper error logging
- Add more configuration options
- Consider adding more content extraction methods
