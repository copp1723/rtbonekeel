# TypeScript Strict Mode Issue: src/services/jobQueue.standardized.ts

## Summary
Fix TypeScript strict mode errors in `src/services/jobQueue.standardized.ts`

## Description
This file contains approximately 29 TypeScript errors that need to be fixed to comply with strict mode.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All TypeScript errors in `src/services/jobQueue.standardized.ts` are resolved
- [ ] No `any` types are used unless absolutely necessary (and documented)
- [ ] No type assertions (`as`) are used unless absolutely necessary (and documented)
- [ ] All functions have explicit return types
- [ ] All parameters have explicit types

## Implementation Notes
- Use proper type definitions instead of `any`
- Add null/undefined checks where needed
- Use type guards to narrow types when necessary
- Consider refactoring complex functions into smaller, well-typed functions
