## Acceptance Testing Process

The process for verifying acceptance criteria is as follows:

1. **Feature Implementation**:
   - Developer implements feature according to requirements
   - Developer performs initial verification of acceptance criteria
   - Developer creates or updates automated tests

2. **Code Review**:
   - Peer developers review code for quality and correctness
   - Reviewers verify that acceptance criteria are addressed
   - Automated tests are reviewed for coverage

3. **QA Testing**:
   - QA team tests feature against acceptance criteria
   - QA verifies both functional and non-functional requirements
   - Edge cases and error scenarios are tested
   - Automated tests are executed

4. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Product owner or designated users test the feature
   - Testing focuses on business requirements and usability
   - Feedback is documented and addressed

5. **Final Approval**:
   - Product owner verifies all acceptance criteria are met
   - Any deviations are documented and approved
   - Feature is approved for release

## Criteria Modification Process

Acceptance criteria may need to be modified due to:
- New business requirements
- Technical constraints discovered during implementation
- User feedback from testing
- Changes in project priorities

The process for modifying acceptance criteria is:

1. **Request for Change**:
   - Stakeholder submits change request with justification
   - Impact on schedule, resources, and other features is assessed

2. **Review and Approval**:
   - Product owner reviews change request
   - Technical lead assesses feasibility
   - Project manager evaluates impact on timeline

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - This document is updated with new criteria
   - Changes are clearly marked and versioned
   - All stakeholders are notified of changes

4. **Implementation Adjustment**:
   - Development team adjusts implementation as needed
   - Testing plans are updated to reflect new criteria

Changes to acceptance criteria for in-progress features should be minimized to avoid scope creep and project delays.
