# Notification Channels and Alert Levels

This document describes the notification channels and alert levels implemented in the application, with specific configurations for staging and production environments.

## Overview

The notification system provides different channels and alert levels for various environments (development, staging, production) to ensure that alerts are relevant and actionable while avoiding alert fatigue.

## Notification Channels

The following notification channels are available:

### 1. Email

Email notifications are sent to configured recipients based on alert level and environment.

- **Development**: Disabled by default
- **Staging**: Enabled, but with higher thresholds to reduce noise
- **Production**: Fully enabled for all critical and error alerts

### 2. Slack

Slack notifications are sent to configured channels based on alert level and environment.

- **Development**: Disabled by default
- **Staging**: Enabled for warnings, errors, and critical alerts
- **Production**: Fully enabled for all error and critical alerts

### 3. Sentry

Error tracking with Sentry is used for capturing and monitoring errors.

- **Development**: Enabled for all errors
- **Staging**: Enabled for all errors
- **Production**: Enabled for all errors

### 4. DataDog

Metrics and monitoring with DataDog for tracking alert frequency and patterns.

- **Development**: Enabled for metrics collection
- **Staging**: Enabled for metrics collection
- **Production**: Enabled for metrics collection

### 5. Console

Console logging is always enabled in all environments.

## Alert Levels

The notification system supports the following alert levels:

### 1. Debug

Low-priority information for debugging purposes.

- **Development**: No threshold (all alerts sent)
- **Staging**: Threshold of 100 (send after 100 occurrences)
- **Production**: Threshold of 1000 (send after 1000 occurrences)

### 2. Info

General information about system operation.

- **Development**: No threshold (all alerts sent)
- **Staging**: Threshold of 50 (send after 50 occurrences)
- **Production**: Threshold of 500 (send after 500 occurrences)

### 3. Warning

Potential issues that don't affect core functionality.

- **Development**: No threshold (all alerts sent)
- **Staging**: Threshold of 10 (send after 10 occurrences)
- **Production**: Threshold of 50 (send after 50 occurrences)

### 4. Error

Issues that affect functionality but don't cause system failure.

- **Development**: No threshold (all alerts sent)
- **Staging**: Threshold of 1 (send immediately)
- **Production**: Threshold of 1 (send immediately)

### 5. Critical

Severe issues that cause system failure or data loss.

- **Development**: No threshold (all alerts sent)
- **Staging**: No threshold (send immediately)
- **Production**: No threshold (send immediately)

## Configuration

Notification channels and alert levels can be configured through environment variables:

```
# Enable/disable notification channels
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_ENABLED="false"
NOTIFICATION_SLACK_ENABLED="false"
NOTIFICATION_SENTRY_ENABLED="true"
NOTIFICATION_DATADOG_ENABLED="true"

# Notification thresholds
NOTIFICATION_THRESHOLD_DEBUG="0"
NOTIFICATION_THRESHOLD_INFO="0"
NOTIFICATION_THRESHOLD_WARNING="0"
NOTIFICATION_THRESHOLD_ERROR="0"
NOTIFICATION_THRESHOLD_CRITICAL="0"

# Notification recipients
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS="dev-team@example.com"
NOTIFICATION_SLACK_CHANNELS="#dev-alerts"
```

## Usage

To send a notification, use the `notificationService`:

```typescript
import { sendNotification } from '../services/notificationService';

// Send a notification
await sendNotification(
  'Database connection failed',
  'error',
  {
    component: 'database',
    details: { error: 'Connection timeout' }
  }
);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate alert levels**: Choose the correct alert level based on the severity of the issue.
2. **Include relevant context**: Always include details that help diagnose the issue.
3. **Avoid alert fatigue**: Use higher thresholds for less critical alerts in production.
4. **Test notifications**: Verify that notifications are working in staging before deploying to production.
5. **Review alert patterns**: Regularly review alert patterns to identify recurring issues.

## Environment-Specific Considerations

### Staging Environment

- Higher thresholds for debug, info, and warning alerts to reduce noise
- Immediate notifications for errors and critical issues
- Notifications sent to staging-specific channels and recipients

### Production Environment

- Very high thresholds for debug and info alerts to minimize noise
- Low thresholds for warnings to catch potential issues early
- Immediate notifications for errors and critical issues
- Notifications sent to production support and on-call teams
