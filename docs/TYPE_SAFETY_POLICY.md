# Type Safety Policy

This document outlines our project's type safety policy and the process for handling exceptions to these rules.

## Core Principles

1. **Strong Type Safety**: We prioritize type safety throughout the codebase to prevent runtime errors and improve code quality.
2. **No Implicit Any**: All variables, parameters, and return types must have explicit types.
3. **No Type Assertions**: Type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown`) should be avoided whenever possible.
4. **No Type Ignores**: TypeScript ignore comments (`@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`) are forbidden except in rare, documented cases.

## ESLint Rules

Our ESLint configuration enforces these principles with the following key rules:

- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: Forbids the use of the `any` type
- `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`: Prevents the use of `@ts-ignore` comments without proper documentation
- `@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type`: Requires explicit return types on functions
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment`: Prevents assigning values of type `any`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-call`: Prevents calling functions of type `any`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access`: Prevents accessing properties on values of type `any`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return`: Prevents returning values of type `any`

## Exception Process

In rare cases, exceptions to these rules may be necessary. Follow this process to request an exception:

### 1. Create an Exception Request

Create a new issue in the project repository with the following information:

- Title: `[TYPE EXCEPTION] Brief description of the exception`
- Description:
  - File path and line number(s) where the exception is needed
  - Detailed explanation of why the exception is necessary
  - Attempts made to solve the issue without an exception
  - Proposed timeline for resolving the exception (if temporary)

### 2. Review Process

The exception request will be reviewed by at least two senior developers who will:

- Verify that the exception is truly necessary
- Suggest alternatives if possible
- Assign an exception ID if approved

### 3. Implementing the Exception

If approved, implement the exception using the following format:

```typescript
// For @ts-ignore exceptions:
// @ts-ignore: [EXCEPTION-ID] Brief explanation of why this is necessary

// For any type exceptions:
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
// [EXCEPTION-ID] Brief explanation of why this is necessary
```

### 4. Documentation

All approved exceptions must be documented in the `TYPE_EXCEPTIONS.md` file with:

- Exception ID
- Location (file path and line number)
- Justification
- Approval date
- Expiration date (if temporary)
- Owner responsible for resolving the exception

### 5. Regular Review

All exceptions will be reviewed quarterly to:

- Verify if they are still necessary
- Check if expired exceptions have been resolved
- Update documentation as needed

## Enforcement

This policy is enforced through:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: ESLint runs on all staged files before commit
2. **CI Pipeline**: ESLint runs on all pull requests
3. **Code Review**: Reviewers should verify that no unapproved exceptions exist
