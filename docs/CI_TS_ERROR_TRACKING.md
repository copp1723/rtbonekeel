# TypeScript Error Tracking in CI/CD

This document describes how TypeScript error tracking is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

The TypeScript error tracking system runs as a non-blocking job in our CI/CD pipeline. It tracks the number of TypeScript errors in the codebase over time, allowing the team to monitor progress towards zero TypeScript errors.

## How It Works

1. The `track-ts-errors.sh` script runs the TypeScript compiler in `--noEmit` mode and captures all errors
2. The script generates two files:
   - `ts-errors.log`: Raw TypeScript compiler output
   - `ts-errors-summary.md`: A categorized summary of errors

3. The CI/CD pipeline:
   - Runs this script on every PR and push to main
   - Uploads the error logs as artifacts
   - Posts a summary comment on PRs with the error count

## Viewing Error Reports

### In Pull Requests

Each PR will receive a comment with:
- Total error count
- Expandable section with the full error summary
- Link to download the full error logs

### In CI Artifacts

The full error logs are available as artifacts in the GitHub Actions run:
1. Go to the Actions tab in the repository
2. Select the "TypeScript Error Tracking" workflow run
3. Download the "typescript-error-logs" artifact

## Reducing Error Threshold

As the project matures and TypeScript errors are fixed, the team can consider:

1. Setting a maximum error threshold that PRs must meet
2. Gradually reducing this threshold over time
3. Eventually making the job blocking when the error count reaches zero

To implement a threshold, modify the `ts-error-tracking.yml` workflow to add a step that fails if the error count exceeds the threshold.

## Notifications

The current implementation posts comments on PRs. For additional notifications:

- **Slack Notifications**: Add a step to the workflow that sends a message to a Slack channel when the error count changes significantly
- **GitHub Status Checks**: Configure the workflow to report a status check based on whether the error count is below the threshold
