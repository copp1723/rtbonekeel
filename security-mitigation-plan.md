# Security Vulnerability Mitigation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for ongoing management of security vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.

## Current Status

All high and critical vulnerabilities have been addressed. The remaining low and moderate vulnerabilities have been documented and accepted as the risk is minimal compared to the potential impact of breaking changes.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Short-term Actions

1. **Regular Auditing**
   - Run `npm audit` weekly to identify new vulnerabilities
   - Document all findings and actions taken

2. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add npm audit checks to the CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure to fail builds on high or critical vulnerabilities
   - Example configuration for GitHub Actions:
   ```yaml
   name: Security Audit
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main, develop ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main, develop ]
     schedule:
       - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Run weekly

   jobs:
     audit:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Setup Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: '18'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm ci
         - name: Run security audit
           run: npm audit --audit-level=high
   ```

3. **Dependency Updates**
   - Use `npm outdated` to identify outdated packages
   - Prioritize updating packages with security vulnerabilities
   - Schedule regular dependency updates (monthly)

### Medium-term Actions

1. **Replace Vulnerable Dependencies**
   - Research alternatives for csurf with the cookie vulnerability
   - Consider implementing custom CSRF protection if needed

2. **Dependency Monitoring**
   - Set up automated dependency monitoring with tools like Dependabot or Snyk
   - Configure alerts for new vulnerabilities

3. **Code Review Process**
   - Add security review checklist for new dependencies
   - Verify that new dependencies don't introduce vulnerabilities

### Long-term Actions

1. **Security Policy**
   - Develop a formal security policy for the project
   - Define acceptable risk levels and remediation timelines
   - Document procedures for vulnerability management

2. **Dependency Strategy**
   - Minimize dependencies where possible
   - Prefer well-maintained libraries with good security track records
   - Consider vendoring critical dependencies to control update timing

3. **Education**
   - Train team members on security best practices
   - Share knowledge about common vulnerabilities and how to avoid them

## Accepted Risks

The following vulnerabilities have been accepted with documented justification:

1. **cookie < 0.7.0** (Low)
   - Issue: cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters
   - Justification: Low severity, fixing requires breaking changes to csurf
   - Mitigation: The application uses proper input validation for cookie values

2. **esbuild <= 0.24.2** (Moderate)
   - Issue: esbuild enables any website to send requests to the development server
   - Justification: Only affects development environment, not production
   - Mitigation: Development servers are run in controlled environments

## Review Schedule

This mitigation plan will be reviewed quarterly to ensure it remains effective and up-to-date.
