# Route Handler Refactoring

This document outlines the changes made to standardize route handlers and response formats across the application.

## Problem

Previously, route handlers were inconsistent in how they returned responses:

1. Some returned raw Response objects
2. Some used different response formats
3. Error handling was inconsistent
4. TypeScript was reporting errors due to Response objects being returned

## Solution

We've implemented a standardized approach to route handlers with consistent response formatting:

1. Created utility functions for standardized responses
2. Implemented a centralized error handling middleware
3. Created an asyncHandler wrapper for consistent error handling
4. Refactored route handlers to use the new pattern

## Key Files

- `src/utils/routeHandler.ts` - Contains the asyncHandler wrapper
- `src/utils/apiResponse.ts` - Contains standardized response formatting functions
- `src/middleware/errorMiddleware.ts` - Centralized error handling middleware
- `src/server/routes/schedules.refactored.ts` - Example of refactored route
- `src/server/routes/workflows.refactored.ts` - Example of refactored route

## Usage

### Before:

```typescript
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const data = await getData();
    return res.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong' });
  }
});
```

### After:

```typescript
router.get('/', asyncHandler(async (req) => {
  return await getData();
}));
```

## Response Format

All API responses now follow a consistent format:

### Success Response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Success message",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error Response:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error message",
  "stack": "Error stack trace (development only)"
}
```

## Testing

Unit and integration tests have been added to verify the behavior of the new route handlers:

- `tests/unit/middleware/errorMiddleware.test.ts`
- `tests/integration/routes/routeHandler.test.ts`

## Next Steps

1. Refactor remaining route handlers to use the new pattern
2. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
3. Consider adding request validation middleware
